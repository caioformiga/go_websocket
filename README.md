# go_websocket
A simple websocket example, based on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dniVs0xKYKk].


1. Start server running 'go run server/server.go'.

2. Use live-server [https://github.com/tapio/live-server] to start a client request from index.html.
obs: Tested using live-server at vscode [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer]  

3. Inspects console at live-server host:port to check messages exchange from index.html to server.

4. Keep track at terminal/console to check server working.
